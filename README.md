# CloudSync
An end-to-end encrypted cloud storage system from scratch using C#. Enables secure file transfer and storage from any computer through a secure user account system.
#
The Server and Client represent two separate applications. The corresponding CS files and .exe can be found within the Server and Client directory. It is recommended to run the application in the dedicated directory provided.
#
This is a pretty rough draft of this project... The stored files aren't encrypted, cannot delete users, appends to files if they already exist, etc...
